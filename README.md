This repo is a fork of our official repo for better understanding and visualization.

## What do we have here?
We first studied pytorch, then begun to study and implement the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04673

- `learning_pytortch` has two notebooks understanding simple pytorh concepts by making 'reverse-engineering";
- .py files define important functions and scripts
- exploring_static_masks.ipynb varies for each branch:
  - "complete_mnsit" has a complete MNIST training with almost all configurations like the paper;
  - "complete_cifar10" has a complete MNIST training with almost all configurations like the paper;
