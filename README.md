This repo is a fork of our official repo for better understanding and visualization. The main branch is highly outdated; please focus on the others.

## What do we have here?
We first studied PyTorch, then began to study and implement the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04673

- **learning_pytortch** has two notebooks for understanding simple PyTorch concepts through 'reverse-engineering';

- **.py** files define important functions and scripts

- **exploring_static_masks.ipynb** notebook varies across each branch:

  - "complete_mnist" has a complete MNIST training with almost all the configurations described in the paper;

  - "complete_cifar10" has a complete CIFAR-10 training with almost all the configurations described in the paper;
